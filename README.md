SIMPLE SHELL TASK

Description
a straightforward UNIX command interpreter that mimics simple shell (sh) features. There are also additional features included. This application was created as a landmark project in C.

Installation
This repository should be cloned into the working directory. For best results, files should be compiled with GCC and the following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89

Usage
After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.

Interactive Mode
In interactive mode, simply run the program and wait for the prompt to appear. From there, you can type commands freely, exiting with either the "exit" command or ctrl-D.
